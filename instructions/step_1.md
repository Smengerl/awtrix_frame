| `../print/diffusor/diffusor.stl`    | <img src="./diffusor/diffusor.png"/>    | 2        | Standard white PLA gave best diffusor effect |
| `../print/diffusor/grid_middle.stl` | <img src="./diffusor/grid_middle.png"/> | 2        | Use full black PETG for best stability and contrast |
| `../print/diffusor/grid_side.stl`   | <img src="./diffusor/grid_side.png"/>   | 4        | Use full black PETG for best stability and contrast |

Assembly:
- Snap in the grids to the diffusor from both directions
- Use the larger "middle grid" to tie both diffusor part together as shown in assembly animation
- One outside wall of the "diffusor_side" is a little thinner than the other wall. Use this to face to the middle grid to achieve best look  
- make sure the upper grid is fully pressed in so that surface of diffusor and grid is fully leveled, this may require some force
